# dual-annihilator
The two Maple modules are for computing a basis for the ideal of recurrence relations of multi-dimensional sequences.

degmroot.mpl:
This module computes a (vector space) basis for the annihilator (the ideal of recurrence relations) of a given mult-dimensional sequence (by its value over its finite support) up to a given degree. There annihilator does not need to be m-primary.

annihilator.mpl:
This module computes a (vector space) basis for the annihilator (the ideal of recurrence relations) of a given mult-dimensional sequence (by its value over its finite support). There annihilator must be m-primary, or equivalently the entries of the sequence of its finite support must be zero.

example.mw file contains examples that are mentioned in the original paper.
